A homework assignment I completed for my Moblie Developement class.
We were required to create a database where a user could add n random colors. The database store the RGB values for each color, an id, and if the color was a favorite or not indicated by chekcing the checkbox on the recycler view.
The app show each color that is in the database and allows users to sort by red, green, blue, favorite, or defualt (how the colors entered the database).
